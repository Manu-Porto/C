# Introduction to Programming in C - BeeCrowd Challenges

This repository was created in 2020 during the SSC0304 course at the Institute of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (ICMC). The course focused on Introduction to Programming for Engineering using the C language. The majority of the code files are named with numbers, corresponding to challenges from the BeeCrowd platform.

I successfully completed the course with a grade of 9.5/10, culminating in the submission of a C language-based Battleship project. The course, spanning 120 credits, provided a comprehensive introduction to programming concepts for engineering students.
